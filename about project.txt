Key Issues and Solutions Implemented:
1. Global Variables Problem
Your original code loads the model and class list every time a frame is processed. I've fixed this by:

Using @st.cache_resource for the model (loaded once)
Using @st.cache_data for class labels
Making them global variables accessible to the VideoTransformer

2. WebRTC Configuration
Added proper RTC configuration with STUN servers for better connectivity:
pythonRTC_CONFIGURATION = RTCConfiguration({
    "iceServers": [{"urls": ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"]}]
})
3. Performance Optimization

Added frame resizing for large images
Added confidence threshold filtering
Enabled async_processing=True
Added media stream constraints

4. Error Handling

Added try-catch blocks throughout
Safe model loading with fallbacks
Better error messages

5. Deployment Considerations
For Streamlit Cloud (share.streamlit.io):

Issue: Streamlit Cloud tries to access the camera on the server, not the user's browser
Solution: Deploy on platforms that support WebRTC properly (like Heroku, Railway, or your own server)
